If you are using the traditional ES5 syntax with `React.createClass`, include ReactCSS.inline as a mixin:
```javascript
var ReactCSS = require('reactcss');

var Button = React.createClass({
  mixins: [ ReactCSS.mixin ],

  ...
});
```

If you are using the new ES6 syntax, you just have to extend ReactCSS.Component instead of React.Component. This is until the guys at react sort out multiple inheritance.
```javascript
var ReactCSS = require('reactcss');

class Button extends ReactCSS.Component {
  ...
}
```
